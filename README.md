# Data Visualization Project Work

## Abstract

For those who may not know, **_Elon Musk_** is one of the world's most influential and richest people. He owns companies like _Tesla_, _SpaceX_, and the social platform _X_ (formerly _Twitter_). His name is also linked to companies like _OpenAI_. Following various events in the stock market, the community coined the term **_"Musk Effect"_** to describe Elon Musk's ability to significantly move markets, sometimes with just a single **_Tweet_**. In this presentation, I will cover some episodes specifically focusing on **_Dogecoin_**, a cryptocurrency famously supported by Elon Musk.
